```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
sapply(lawsuit, function(na) sum(is.na(na)))
lawsuit_cor = lawsuit %>% 
  select(-id, - sal94, -sal95)
cor(lawsuit_cor)%>%                            
  corrplot(method = "circle", type = "upper", diag=FALSE, title = "Correlation Plot")
```

There may be a collinearity issue where we can see from the plot above. 

`prate` is highly correlated with `dept` and `clin`. 

`clin` is highly correlated with`dept`.

`rank` is highly correlated with `exper`.
