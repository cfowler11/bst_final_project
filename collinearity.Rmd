```{r, message=FALSE}
lawsuit = read_csv("./Lawsuit.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sal_avg = (sal94 + sal95)/2)


sapply(lawsuit, function(na) sum(is.na(na)))

cor(lawsuit_cor)%>%                            
  corrplot(method = "circle", type = "upper", diag=FALSE, title = "Correlation Plot")

## Matrix 
res <- cor(lawsuit_cor)
round(res, 2)

## Heatmap
col<- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(20)
heatmap(x = res, col = col, symm = TRUE)


library(GGally)
lawsuit_cor%>% 
  GGally::ggpairs(
    columns = c("dept", "clin", "rank", "cert", "prate", "exper"),
    lower = list(
      continous = "smooth", 
      combo = "box",
      mapping = aes(color = gender),
      upper = "blank"
    )
  )
```

There may be a collinearity issue where we can see from the plot above. 

`prate` is highly correlated with `dept` and `clin`. 

`clin` is highly correlated with`dept`.

`rank` is highly correlated with `exper`.
